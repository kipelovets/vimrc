# .vimrc

This is a combination of my old VIM settings and newly created NeoVim config 

# neovim

`nvim` folder is supposed to be linked to `~/.config/nvim`

Requirements:

```
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
brew install --cask font-fira-code-nerd-font
```

## Fun

```
:CellularAutomaton make_it_rain
